1. Choose a Cloud Provider:
Select cloud like AWS, Azure, or GCP based on business needs, scalability, and cost.
2. Set Up Infrastructure
Use Infrastructure as Code tools like Terraform, AWS CloudFormation to provision resources.
Set up Virtual Machines (EC2), Containers (ECS/EKS), or Serverless AWS Lambda based on the application type.
3. Containerization:
Dockerize the application to ensure consistency across environments.
Use Kubernetes (EKS) or a managed container service like AWS ECS for orchestration.
4. CI/CD Pipeline Setup
Use Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, or AWS CodePipeline to automate builds, testing, and deployment.
Store the code in GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket
5. Deployment Strategy
Choose a deployment strategy based on the business requirements:
Rolling Deployment: Gradually replace instances to minimize downtime.
Blue-Green Deployment: Switch traffic between old and new versions for zero downtime.
Canary Deployment: Release updates to a small percentage of users before full rollout.
6. Monitoring and Logging
Use CloudWatch (AWS) for logging,monitoring and alerts.
Implement Prometheus and Grafana for observability.
7. Security & Compliance
Use IAM roles and policies to manage permissions.
Implement WAF (Web Application Firewall) for protection against attacks.
8. Autoscaling & Load Balancing
Use Auto Scaling Groups to handle traffic spikes.
Set up Load Balancers (ALB, NLB, or Cloud Load Balancer) to distribute traffic efficiently.
9. Backup & Disaster Recovery
Enable automated backups using snapshots and replication.
Implement multi-region deployments for high availability.
10. Final Testing & Go Live
Perform end-to-end testing.
Deploy the application in production with monitoring and rollback mechanisms.
